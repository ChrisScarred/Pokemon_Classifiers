<br/>
	This project evaluates the performance of different classifiers of Pokémons’ primary types. Each of the compared classifiers is Multinomial Logistic Regression or a Decision Tree Classifier and differs in the attributes used for classifying. Every possible combination of two attributes is evaluated in terms of accuracy and its performance compared with an all attributes classifier of the corresponding type. It was found that there is little significant difference in the performance of the best two-attribute Multinomial Logistic Regression classifier and the all-attributes Multinomial Logistic Regression classifier. However, two-attribute decision trees generally performed better than the all-attribute ones.
